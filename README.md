## Setting up Notion API
Scaffold uses an import script, connecting to a Notion database of your choosing and converting into JSON before reading it within the page.


### Initial setup and auth
Follow steps 1 and 2 in the [Notion API Getting Started](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started) to create the Databases you'll be reading from, and to generate the API key.

Create a .env file in the root folder of the project with the following contents:
```
NOTION_KEY=<your-api-key>
NOTION_DATABASE_<NAME>=<each-unique-database-id>
```


### Mapping the data
The return you get from the Notion database has heaps of attributes, but you likely only need a few.

To map the data you need, edit the `src/scripts/notionToJson.js` file, and follow the instructions in the comments.


### Running the script

```
npm run notion
```
